# Air_Quality_Index-Delhi-_Shadowfox
I’m excited to share that I have successfully completed the Intermediate Level 
Task as part of my Data Science Internship at ShadowFox. 
Task Focus: Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis for Delhi The objective was to explore how different pollutants affect air quality, identify seasonal patterns, and generate insights using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). 
Collected and cleaned the dataset for analysis. 
Handled missing values and formatted date-time columns for proper time-series exploration. 
Conducted EDA on major pollutants – PM2.5, PM10, SO₂, NO₂, CO, and O₃. 
Created visualizations: Line plots showing AQI changes over time. 
Heatmaps for pollutant correlations. 
Seasonal and monthly distribution graphs. 
Compared pollutant levels with WHO and Indian air quality standards.
